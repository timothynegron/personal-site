                  Markup languages are used by computer programmers to arrange
                  content within what they're creating in code. Markup languages
                  come with a set of tags that can be used to tell a computer
                  how the content assigned to the tag is intended to be
                  displayed, arranged, or behave. The content and tag make up
                  what is referred too as an <strong>element</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In software development, a <strong>tag</strong> is a piece of
                  code that tells the computer what type of content is within
                  the tag. Tags are made with characters and or or symbols which
                  are used to tell the computer what to do with the content that
                  is after or between it. If the syntax within the tag is
                  erroneous, or logically incorrect, then the computer would not
                  translate the content correctly or at all.
                </p>

                <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
                <p>
                  Markdown is one of many markup languages. In Markdown, tags
                  can contain content types such as text or a link source of a
                  website, image, or YouTube video.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In example, a header tag can be used to create a title.
                  Emphasis tags can be used to make text in
                  <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italics</em>. And an image tag
                  can be used to display an image within the document. Here's
                  how the source code for those examples would look in a
                  Markdown file:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-section"># Title</span>
<span class="hljs-strong">**bold**</span>
<span class="hljs-emphasis">*italics*</span>
![<span class="hljs-string">alt My Image</span>](<span class="hljs-link">image.png</span>)</div></code></pre>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Markdown files require a .md file extension.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Markdown's source code is much easier for a human to read and
                  write compared to other markup languages such as HTML. This is
                  why Markdown is widely used by computer programmers to create
                  quick documents that explain a computer program they've
                  written. As another example, Markdown is also used to write
                  down instructions like how to install and execute an
                  application in discussion within GitHub.

                <p>
                  HTML is another markup language that is used in software
                  development. Like Markdown, HTML has tags to create and format
                  elements, however, in HTML the tags can also contain
                  attributes. In HTML, <strong>attributes</strong> give a
                  computer more data about how an element should be presented.
                  This gives someone programming a computer more control over
                  the contents within the tag. An attribute is a component of an
                  element that can be added if desired.

                <p>
                  In example, a header tag can use a style attribute with a
                  color property and red as its value to change the color of the
                  text to red. Here's the source code for that example in HTML:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">h1</span> <span class="hljs-attr">style</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"color: red;"</span>&gt;</span>Title<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">h1</span>&gt;</span>
                </div></code></pre>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In order to get a similar result in Markdown, you would have
                    to use HTML.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  As you can see in the code above, not only is the syntax
                  different compared with Markdown but HTML tags also always
                  requires a closing tag - unlike most Markdown tags. Attributes
                  must be referenced in the opening tag. The difference between
                  Markdown and HTML expand dramatically when utilizing its
                  ability to integrate CSS and Javascript.

                <p>
                  CSS is known as a styling language - not a markup language. It
                  is supported by a number of languages. In HTML, CSS is used by
                  computer programmers to style HTML elements. Where HTML is
                  designed for structuring elements, CSS is designed for styling
                  them. They are countless ways to present your content with CSS
                  with how your font looks, the color of your background, how
                  your elements are arranged, and you can even add some
                  animation to your elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In CSS, a string of characters, and regularly with also one or
                  two symbols, identify a selector.
                  <strong>Selectors</strong> can contain a number of property
                  and value pairs. Here is an example of how to define a
                  selector when writing CSS code:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-selector-tag">name-of-selector</span> {
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
}</div></code></pre>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    CSS code can be stored in a .html file but is conventionally
                    stored in a .css file.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A <strong>property</strong> is a characteristic that is
                  assigned to an element and a <strong>value</strong> is the
                  data representing the details of that characteristic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most commonly used selectors in CSS are
                  <em>tag selectors</em>, <em>class selectors</em>, and
                  <em>id selectors</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Selectors with the same name as an HTML tag, such as
                  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, do not have to be referenced,
                  assigned an attribute-value pair, in an opening tag. These
                  selectors are referred to as tag selectors. For example:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> {
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
}</div></code></pre>
                <p>Where <code>h1</code> is a known element in HTML.</p>
                <p>
                  Class selectors, however, must be referenced in HTML by
                  utilizing the <strong>class attribute</strong> inside the
                  opening tag of an element. They are used to set elements with
                  a specific set of properties like tag selectors but class
                  selectors are not limited to affecting only one element. For
                  example, in CSS:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-selector-class">.class-selector-name</span> {
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
<span class="hljs-attribute">property</span>: value;
}</div></code></pre>
                <p>And in HTML:</p>
                <pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">ol</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"class-selector-name"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">ol</span>&gt;</span>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    It's also important to point out that
                    <strong
                      >more than one class can be used in a HTML tag</strong

                <p>
                  While tag selectors affect all elements with the same tag name
                  and class selectors are used for groups of elements or more
                  than one element, ID selectors are used to be set only with
                  one element. ID selectors have to be referenced in HTML with a
                  <strong>id attribute</strong>. Here's how that looks in CSS:
                </p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"
                ><code><div><span class="hljs-selector-id">#id-selector-name</span> {

                <p>And in HTML:</p>
                <pre
                  class="hljs"

                  distance from other elements.
                  <strong
                    >Each element contains a content box enveloped by a padding
                    box, border box, and margin box</strong
                  >. A computer programmer can control each of these components
                  by manipulating their property values in code. This gives them
                  the ability to arrange content wherever they wish.

                  Introduction to CSS Flexbox
                </h2>
                <p>
                  <em>Flexbox</em> is a CSS Layout Module that gives computer
                  programmers the ability to easily arrange or change the
                  appearance of HTML elements. It also helps computer
                  programmers create responsive websites effortlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Responsive websites</strong> display elements the way
                  a computer programmer intends for it to be displayed
                  regardless of window size, screen size, and device type. In
                  example, with responsive web design, if a browser's window on
                  a personal computer is expanded or reduce horizontally or
                  vertically, the elements that are rendered will adapt to the
                  window's new dimensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In CSS, the Flexbox module can be added by simply writing
                  <code>display: flex</code> within the curly braces of a
                  selector. Then, a computer programmer can add one or two more
                  simple lines of code to quickly place the elements where they
                  wish. The results Flexbox has the ability to output can be
                  accomplished without Flexbox but would require more lines of
                  code and skill.

                  Here is an image of what Flexbox can accomplish with just

                  Introduction to the Command Line Interface
                </h2>
                <p>
                  A <em>command line interface</em>, also often referred to as
                  CLI in text, is a way of interacting with a computer like a
                  graphical user interface, however, it is a text based
                  interface. Like a graphical user interface, with a command
                  line interface, the user can create, read, update and delete
                  files and folders. They can also run applications, view a
                  calendar, install applications from the internet, and much
                  more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A command line interface program must be given
                  <strong>commands</strong> as inputs, and can also receive
                  arguments after the command, to perform task and navigate
                  through the interface. Computer programmers should learn how
                  to use the command line interface because of how much can be
                  accomplish with one single line of characters and symbols.

                  In summary, in software development, markup languages are used
                  for structuring content within a screen display. HTML is used
                  for structuring elements and CSS is used for styling elements.
                  Markdown is a simple markup language that can be used to write
                  clear plain text media. The box model is a way of thinking
                  about how a browser determines the size and distance of
                  elements. Flexbox is a CSS Module that can be used to arrange
                  or change the appearance of HTML elements. Finally, a command
                  line interface is another way to interact with a computer like
                  a graphical user interface, however, it is more time efficient
                  and as a result gives computer programmers more power.
