                      Version control systems, VCS, are used to help keep track
                      of changes that are made to a project over a period of
                      time. It is used by groups of people working on
                      spreadsheets, word documents, photo editors, computer
                      code, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <em>GIT</em> is one of many version control systems that
                      is used in software development. With GIT, computer
                      programmers can send a version of their code to Git
                      servers. Once their code is on a Git server, with Git and
                      GitHub other computer programmers can get a copy of that
                      code. The action of sending code to the cloud is called
                      <strong>push</strong> and the action of downloading a
                      version of code from a server to a personal computer is
                      called <strong>clone</strong>. <em>GitHub</em> is a web
                      application that computer programmers use
                      <em>to manage versions of their code on Git servers</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Almost all computer programmers use a local computers
                      command line interface to perform Git actions. This is
                      because of how quick and easy it is to do compared when
                      using a graphical user interface. To start a repository
                      within a local machine, they must first perform the
                      <strong>git init</strong> command within the directory
                      they choose to work on within a computer. In example, on a
                      terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git init</span>
                    
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/Documents/new-directory/.git/
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <p>
                      With the git init command, a folder named .git will be
                      created in the computers storage. This is the local
                      repository. In software development, a
                      <strong>repository</strong> is a storage location for
                      storing files with computer code and the different
                      versions of that code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is important for computer programmers to track code
                      changes that are made over a period of time. This is
                      because when new features are added to the code, it is
                      possible to come across issues that cause the code to not
                      function properly or at all. Saving different versions of
                      that code allows computer programmers to not only start
                      from scratch but possibly even identify what went wrong
                      when adding a new feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When a computer programmer wants to send new changes to
                      their code to a Git server, the remote repository, they
                      will first have to use the
                      <strong>git add</strong> command. For example, on a
                      terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git add main.js</span>
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        To see if the changes were added use the
                        <strong>git status</strong> command.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      This metaphorically adds the file with new changes in
                      &quot;a box&quot;. Once, the computer programmer is done
                      adding files with changes to &quot;the box&quot; with the
                      git add command, they need to use the
                      <strong>git commit</strong> command to, metaphorically,
                      package the file and &quot;label it&quot;. For example, on
                      a terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"Adds friends list"</span></span>
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <p>
                      Where <strong>-m</strong> gives them the ability to add a
                      message - or &quot;label&quot;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The &quot;git package&quot;, which is now in the .git
                      folder that was created earlier with the git init command,
                      is now ready to be moved to the Git server. To finally
                      move the new changes, or send &quot;the box&quot;, to the
                      Git server, a computer programmer must use the
                      <strong>git push</strong> command. Simply, on a terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git push</span>
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        To see a log of all Git activity, use the
                        <strong>git log</strong> command.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      The new changes have been moved to the server. Every time
                      a computer programmer wants to add changes to a Git
                      server, they would repeat this process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With the code now on the Git server, other computer
                      programmers have the ability to get a copy of that code.
                      They can get a copy of the code by logging onto GitHub's
                      web application and going onto the webpage with the
                      repository of that code, then fork it.
                      <strong>Fork</strong> is when a copy of code is made onto
                      a Git account from another Git account. Once the forked
                      version is on their account, they can clone the code onto
                      their computer with the <strong>git clone</strong> command
                      and the repositories URL. In example, on a terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git <span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span> https://github.com/user/repo</span>
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Also with GitHub, computer programmers can compare
                        previous versions of their code with the current and
                        vice versa.
                      </p>

                    <p>
                      When the command above is entered, a copy will be made
                      under the directory where the command was entered and the
                      code can now be edited on that computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If a computer programmer is invited to
                      <strong>collaborate</strong> on the project, they can use
                      the <strong>git pull</strong> command to get the latest
                      copy of any code that has been pushed to the git servers
                      by other programmers working on the same code. In example,
                      on a terminal:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">a-directory-name$</span><span class="bash"> git pull</span>
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <p>
                      If a programmers pushes changes to a file that a
                      co-programmer was working on and then that co-programmer
                      pulls the new changes, a
                      <strong>conflict</strong> would occur. The co-programmer
                      that pulled the code from the git server could then choose
                      to <strong>merge</strong> both files, decline any changes,
                      or accept the new changes and not keep the changes they've
                      made. To avoid conflicts, programmers must communicate and
                      plan out stages of development.

                      JavaScript is a programming language that was originally
                      designed to build interactive web pages. Later, it was
                      made possible to run outside of a web browser with a
                      technology called Node. Node gave developers the ability
                      to program mobile applications, command-line tools, and
                      more with JavaScript. Today, JavaScript is one of the
                      most, if not the most, popular programming language.

                      With JavaScript, variable names can be created and each
                      variable can be set with a value. The value can be of many

                        <strong>String:</strong> an array of characters and
                        symbols in quotations.

                      Creating Variables in JavaScript
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Creating variables in JavaScript is more straight forward
                      than other computer programming languages. To create a
                      variable in JavaScript, you must use the
                      <code>let</code> keyword before the name of the variable.
                      The variable name cannot contain spaces. In example:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> myFirstVariable = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <p>
                      The line of JavaScript code above creates a variable with
                      a type of number. Where the <code>let</code> keyword tells
                      the computer to create a variable,
                      <code>myFirstVariable</code> is the variable name, and
                      <code>= 1</code> sets the value of the variable
                      <code>myFirstVariable</code> to one
                      <em
                        >and tells the computer that the variable has a type of
                        number</em
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here is an example of creating a string variable type:
                    </p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> myFirstString = <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>;
                    </div></code></pre>
                    <p>
                      The single quotes before and after the text,
                      <em
                        >tells the computer that the variable has a type of
                        String</em
                      >.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is an example of creating a boolean variable:</p>
                    <pre
                      class="hljs"
                    ><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> myFirstBoolean = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;

                    <p>
                      True and false, without quotations, is a value and keyword
                      in JavaScript that
                      <em
                        >tells the computer that the type of the variable is
                        boolean</em
